DESCRIPTION OF TASK: 

To clean and preprocess a large dataset using PySpark, we will focus on handling missing values, duplicates, and potentially applying some basic transformations. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:
Steps to clean and preprocess the dataset:
Initialize a Spark Session - This is needed to work with PySpark.
Load the dataset - This could be a CSV file, Parquet file, etc.
Handle Missing Values - You can either drop rows with missing values or fill them with a default value.
Handle Duplicates - Remove any duplicate rows.
Other Preprocessing (optional) - Apply transformations like type casting, renaming columns, etc.
